# MVP-Predictor
This is a model that uses three different machine learning regression tools (Linear Regression, XGBoost and Random Forest) to help predict the 2022 NBA MVP, and to see which past MVPs the models would have chosen.

These models, and the inspiration of the project is based on the work by David Yoo.
